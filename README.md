# Analyze A/B Test Results

## Introduction
For this project, A/B test results of an e-commerce company were analyzed. The data was provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002?gclid=Cj0KCQiA962BBhCzARIsAIpWEL0lOOmzbGbaIbfVKgf_RfffibP67s3UX04z_BY6WJDJTQ3Fe2uL7PwaAgerEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=2045115100_c&utm_keyword=%2Budacity%20%2Bnanodegree%20%2Bdata%20%2Banalyst_b&utm_medium=ads_n&utm_source=gsem_brand&utm_term=74942759920)

In the data provided, the company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The objective of the project is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
